            <h1>Internet Search</h1>
            <p>
                Imagine a world without Google, a world where you couldnt at the click of the mouse order your Friday night meal. Its simply amazing, just 10 years ago there was no Google and exactly 5 years before that there was no way to search the internet. Creators like the founders of yahoo were the first to take a jab at inventing the foundations of a search engine. In the end of all this, there was a high tech revolution that released a massive internet boom along with an economic boost that made the founders into billionaires.

            <h3>Things to consider...</h3>
            <p><br>Jerry Yang and David Filo were the pioneers in creating the Search methodology and one of their first few projects were tied up with the ability for sports fans to be able to view the previous nights stats and scores. They conceptualized the idea based on an Active Directory that was called, Jerry and Davids guide to the world wide web would branch off into many categories of interest for the end user.</p>
            <p>We will fast forward a couple years to Googles beta product which came to life in the year of 1996, called Backrub. Larry and Sergey began working on Backrub, a search engine which utilized backlinks for search. It also ranked pages using citation notation, meaning any mention of a website would count it as a vote toward the mentioned site. In 1998, you have two renowned names take a big leap by launching the MSN Search along with today's giant, Google. It isnt until 1999 that Google gets funding from Sequoia Capital as well as from a few other investors to really put the foot on the metal to optimize their product line. </p>

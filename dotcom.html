            <h1>The Deception in Silicon Valley</h1>
            <p>
                A monumental book by Shoshana Zuboff, called ‘The age of Capitalism’ exposes the dubious mechanisms of our digital economy. According to Zuboff our personal and private experiences have been hijacked by Silicon Valley and used as the raw material for extremely profitable digital products. The term surveillance capitalism is not an arbitrary term. Why must it be called surveillance? In their words, its must be operations that are engineered as undetectable and cloaked promoted ads, while their true intentions are for us to be their consumer purchasing puppets.

            <h3>Things to consider...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What really happens with our Digital content?  </li>
                <li>Why are their hidden microphones in Google Nest? </li>
                <li>Also, never answer security questions online completely truthfully because these are easily accessible by hackers can find a way to guess your general responses or find the answers online.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Some people would say...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>“I like those targeted ads.”</li>
                <li>“Those ads are so useful, or I enjoy personalized services.”</li>
                <li>“You know, I have nothing to hide so I don’t care what the take”</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The truth is, each one of these phrases is a misconception for what is really going on because we as consumers only think that the only personal information, they have on us is what we have given them. As if we have some control over what we can give them and therefore we think that everything is under control.
            </p>
            <hr/>

            <h3>What's really happening...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We provide personal information, but the information we provide is the least important part of the information they collect about us.</li>
                <li>Google knows where we are all the time and what we think.</li>
                <li>Facebook knows our hobbies, preferences, and friends because of all the digital traces we’ve left behind.</li>
            </ul>
